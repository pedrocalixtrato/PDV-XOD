After breaking up with Mark Darcy (Firth), Bridget Jones's (Zellweger) \"happily ever after\" hasn't quite gone according to plan. Fortysomething and single again, she decides to focus on her job as top news producer and surround herself with old friends and new. For once, Bridget has everything completely under control. What could possibly go wrong? Then her love life takes a turn and Bridget meets a dashing American named Jack (Dempsey), the suitor who is everything Mr. Darcy is not. In an unlikely twist she finds herself pregnant, but with one hitch...she can only be fifty percent sure of the identity of her baby's father.

The film, which is directed by David Lowery (\"Ain't Them Bodies Saints\"), is written by Lowery & Toby Halbrooks based on a story by Seton I. Miller and S.S. Field and produced by Jim Whitaker, p.g.a. (\"The Finest Hours,\" \"Friday Night Lights\"), with Barrie M. Osborne (\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,\" \"The Great Gatsby\") serving as executive producer. For years, old wood carver Mr. Meacham (Robert Redford) has delighted local children with his tales of the fierce dragon that resides deep in the woods of the Pacific Northwest. To his daughter, Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), who works as a forest ranger, these stories are little more than tall tales...until she meets Pete (Oakes Fegley). Pete is a mysterious 10-year-old with no family and no home who claims to live in the woods with a giant, green dragon named Elliott. And from Pete's descriptions, Elliott seems remarkably similar to the dragon from Mr. Meacham's stories. With the help of Natalie (Oona Laurence), an 11-year-old girl whose father Jack (Wes Bentley) owns the local lumber mill, Grace sets out to determine where Pete came from, where he belongs, and the truth about this dragon. Disney's \"Pete's Dragon\" opens in U.S. theaters on August 12, 2016.","posters":{"thumbnail":"https://resizing.flixster.com/y3WFlXgTa3PtVQB1zs0LzfHhE54=/54x80/v1.bTsxMjAyNzMzODtwOzE3MTEyOzIwNDg7NTQwOzgwMA","profile":"https://resizing.flixster.com/y3WFlXgTa3PtVQB1zs0LzfHhE54=/54x80/v1.bTsxMjAyNzMzODtwOzE3MTEyOzIwNDg7NTQwOzgwMA","detailed":"https://resizing.flixster.com/y3WFlXgTa3PtVQB1zs0LzfHhE54=/54x80/v1.bTsxMjAyNzMzODtwOzE3MTEyOzIwNDg7NTQwOzgwMA","original":"https://resizing.flixster.com/y3WFlXgTa3PtVQB1zs0LzfHhE54=/54x80/v1.bTsxMjAyNzMzODtwOzE3MTEyOzIwNDg7NTQwOzgwMA"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Bryce Dallas Howard","id":"162660901","characters":["Grace"]},{"name":"Robert Redford","id":"162653875","characters":["Meacham"]},{"name":"Oakes Fegley","id":"771502110","characters":["Pete"]},{"name":"Oona Laurence","id":"771618979","characters":["Natalie"]},{"name":"Wes Bentley","id":"162670889","characters":["Jack"]}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771411737.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/petes_dragon_2016/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771411737/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771411737/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771411737/similar.json"}},{"id":"771410256","title":"Kubo and the Two Strings","year":2016,"mpaa_rating":"PG","runtime":101,"critics_consensus":"","release_dates":{"theater":"2016-08-19"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Certified Fresh","critics_score":97,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":87},"synopsis":"Kubo and the Two Strings is an epic action-adventure set in a fantastical Japan from acclaimed animation studio LAIKA.

With the help of his shamisen - a magical musical instrument - Kubo must battle gods and monsters, including the vengeful Moon King (Academy Award nominee Ralph Fiennes) and the evil twin Sisters (Academy Award nominee Rooney Mara), to unlock the secret of his legacy, reunite his family, and fulfill his heroic destiny.","posters":{"thumbnail":"https://resizing.flixster.com/Y7D2MXxHdUC4cxo7dqshoOsyGhQ=/54x80/v1.bTsxMjExMTgzOTtwOzE3MTQ5OzIwNDg7MjE3OzMyMA","profile":"https://resizing.flixster.com/Y7D2MXxHdUC4cxo7dqshoOsyGhQ=/54x80/v1.bTsxMjExMTgzOTtwOzE3MTQ5OzIwNDg7MjE3OzMyMA","detailed":"https://resizing.flixster.com/Y7D2MXxHdUC4cxo7dqshoOsyGhQ=/54x80/v1.bTsxMjExMTgzOTtwOzE3MTQ5OzIwNDg7MjE3OzMyMA","original":"https://resizing.flixster.com/Y7D2MXxHdUC4cxo7dqshoOsyGhQ=/54x80/v1.bTsxMjExMTgzOTtwOzE3MTQ5OzIwNDg7MjE3OzMyMA"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Art Parkinson","id":"771443330","characters":["Kubo"]},{"name":"Charlize Theron","id":"162654733","characters":["Monkey"]},{"name":"Ralph Fiennes","id":"162653681","characters":["Moon King"]},{"name":"Rooney Mara","id":"770826640","characters":["The Sisters"]},{"name":"George Takei","id":"364615604","characters":["Hosato"]}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771410256.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kubo_and_the_two_strings_2016/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771410256/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771410256/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771410256/similar.json"}},{"id":"771442759","title":"Hell or High Water","year":2016,"mpaa_rating":"R","runtime":102,"critics_consensus":"","release_dates":{"theater":"2016-08-12"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Certified Fresh","critics_score":98,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":90},"synopsis":"Texas brothers--Toby (Chris Pine), and Tanner (Ben Foster), come together after years divided to rob branches of the bank threatening to foreclose on their family land.

As the island's sole inhabitant, he finds comfort in the monotony of the chores and the solitude of his surroundings. When he meets the daughter of the school's headmaster, Isabel Graysmark (Alicia Vikander), in the local town of Partageuse on the mainland, Tom is immediately captivated by her beauty, wit and passion, and they are soon married and living on the island. As their love flourishes, he begins to feel again, their happiness marred only by their inability to start a family, so when a rowboat with a dead man and infant girl mysteriously washes ashore, Isabel believes their prayers may have finally been answered. As a man of principle, Tom is torn between reporting the lost child and pleasing the woman he loves, and against his better judgment he agrees to let Isabel raise the child as their own, making a choice with devastating consequences.
